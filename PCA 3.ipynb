    "* Eigenvalues are scalar values associated with a linear transformation or a square matrix. They represent the scaling factor by which an eigenvector is stretched or compressed when it undergoes the transformation. In other words, eigenvalues indicate the directions along which the transformation has a simple effect.\n",

    "### Eigenvectors:\n",
    "* Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that, when transformed by a square matrix, only change in scale but not in direction (except possibly for a sign change). Each eigenvector corresponds to an eigenvalue and represents a specific direction in the vector space.\n",

    "* In this equation, A is the square matrix being decomposed, P is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, D is a diagonal matrix containing the corresponding eigenvalues.\n",

    "\n",
    "Solving this equation, we find that the eigenvalues of A are λ1 = 4 and λ2 = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each eigenvalue, we find the corresponding eigenvector by substituting it back into the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* (A - λ * I) * v = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "where I is the identity matrix. Solving this equation, we find two eigenvectors:\n",

    "* For λ1 = 4, the corresponding eigenvector v1 = [1, 2]\n",
    "* For λ2 = 1, the corresponding eigenvector v2 = [1, -1]\n",
    "\n",
    "These eigenvectors represent the directions along which the matrix A has a simple effect.\n",

    "To find the eigenvalues of a matrix, you need to solve the characteristic equation, which is obtained by setting the determinant of the matrix subtracted by a scalar multiple of the identity matrix equal to zero. Solving this equation gives the eigenvalues of the matrix. Eigenvalues represent the scalar factors by which the corresponding eigenvectors are scaled when transformed by the matrix. They provide insights into the behavior of the matrix, such as its scaling or stretching effect along specific directions in the vector space. Eigenvalues are important in various applications, including understanding the properties of linear transformations, solving differential equations, and performing dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA."

    "#### Eigenvectors:\n",
    "An eigenvector represents a direction in space that remains unchanged (up to scaling) when transformed by a matrix. When a matrix acts on an eigenvector, the resulting vector points in the same direction as the original eigenvector. The length (magnitude) of the eigenvector may change, but its direction remains constant. Eigenvectors are orthogonal (in the case of a symmetric matrix) or orthogonalizable (in the general case), meaning they are at right angles to each other.\n",

    "Eigenvalues correspond to the scaling factors applied to their associated eigenvectors when transformed by a matrix. They determine how much the eigenvector is stretched or compressed in the direction it represents. Positive eigenvalues indicate stretching, negative eigenvalues indicate compression (reflection), and zero eigenvalues indicate that the corresponding eigenvectors lie in the null space of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometrically, \n",
    "eigenvalues determine the \"stretching factor\" along the direction represented by the eigenvector. If an eigenvalue is greater than 1, it implies stretching in that direction; if it is less than 1, it implies compression. Eigenvalues of 1 indicate no change in scale along the eigenvector direction.\n",
